# Compilation Settings

Compilation itself is very straightforward and similar to installation: you let Wabbajack run and hope it finishes successfully! The key to make it run successfully is having a "Wabbajack-compliant" MO2 setup which you can set up by following the recommendations from the previous sections.

## Find or Generate Your `.compiler_settings`

-   Click on the three dots next to the `Compiler Settings` field.
-   In the file selection window that opens:
    -   If it is your first time compiling a list, navigate to `profiles/{profile_name}/` and select `modlist.txt`. This will generate the required `.compiler_settings` file for this and future compilation.
    -   If you have already used Wabbajack with the MO2 instance you want to compile with or are using [ative-Game-Installer (Installers not using MO2)](<Native-Game-Installer%20-%20(Installers%20not%20using%20MO2).md>), change the file extension from `MO2 Modlist (.txt)` to `Compiler Settings File (.compiler_settings)` and select the `ModlistName.compiler_settings` file.

## Download Location

The download location is the path to the folder where all your archives and `.meta` files are located.

## Output Location

The output location is the path to the folder where your modlist's `.wabbajack` file will be written.

## Wabbajack Compilation Configuration Editor

In Wabbajack, select _Create a Modlist_ to navigate to the configuration screen. Here you can configure some metadata for your modlist which will later be viewable by the user.

| Always Enabled Mods | Adds mod folders to a list of mods that will be included in your list no matter if they are enabled (active in game) or not | Wabbajack will normally ignore all mods you disabled in MO2 but there are some cases where you might want to give some choice to the end user and want to have the mod included                                                                                                                         |

## Compilation Errors

You will likely get a ton of errors during your first compilation, which is to be expected. We highly recommend you join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wabbajack) and go to the `#modlist-development-help` channel for help.
