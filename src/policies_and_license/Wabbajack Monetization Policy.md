# Wabbajack Policy on Monetisation

## YOU CANNOT:

- Have modlists be behind a paywall. This includes access to any form of early release, test build, etc, based on donations or monetary payment.
- Include mods that are behind a paywall, or require paid software (Windows and the game itself excluded) for your list to be installed or run.
  - This means that paid software such as Lossless Scaling, or mods such as PureDarks upscaler, follow the same rules. You may not require them for use in your list, but you may suggest their use as a way to generally increase performance. Aggressive promotion of paid software/mods is not allowed.
  - This means that suggesting the list is 'meant to run' or 'designed only for use' with a specific paid mod/software is not allowed.
- Have paywalled modlist support.
  - This includes exclusive support, 2 tiered support, priority support or any other nomenclature for walling user support either partially or fully behind a paywall.
- Use donation based discord roles to avoid the other rules listed here.
- Enable Donation points on Nexus for the Wabbajack file, or any resources which are only usable within the modlist (Patcher outputs, LODs, etc). This is a Nexus policy.

## YOU CAN:

- You can use donation systems. Patreon, Discord, Ko-Fi, etc. You **MUST** follow all other paywall rules mentioned here.
- You are allowed to have developer builds or testing builds. These cannot be distributed on the basis of donations.
- You can paywall "modding lessons" or something of the like that is advertised through your modlist community but not technically related to WJ except tangentially.
  - To ensure there is no abuse of this, we require you add Wabbajack admins to view these channels so we can ensure you are not paywalling content or support.
- You can paywall content creation (e.g. YouTube, private streams) based on your modlist and development of it.
- You can take paid commissions for modlists or additions to modlists. **YOU MUST** comply with the other rules with commissions. This is at the modlist developers descretion and is directly their responsibility. The Wabbajack team takes no responsibility for any paid for commissions made between a user and a modlist developer.
  - All commissioned work must be freely available **immediately** (Nexus, GitHub, Publicly on Discord, etc.) Ask if you have an idea and are not sure whether your preferred method of provision complies.
We have tried to be open and allow for rules that allow modlist developers to make money from their work if they wish, without compromising Wabbajack and what it stands for. Please ask if you are unsure of any of the rules laid out here.
- Enable Donation Points on mods & patches you create for the list which are usable outside of the modlist. Nexus considers these mods of general use, thus can have DP enabled on them.

This policy applies to *ALL* modlists compiled with Wabbajack and is not limited to lists with featured status.

All violations of the above will be considered serious violations of ToS and the admin team reserves the right to completely remove modlists which are in violation of our Terms of Service.
